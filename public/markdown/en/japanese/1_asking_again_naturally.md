#### Asking again naturally

Let's learn expressions which we can use when we didn't understand someone saying Japanese.<br>

---

##### 1. When you didn't hear someone's talking

It's better to use ’うん？’.<br>
’はあ？’ is not recommended.<br><br>

##### 2. When there's a expression you don't understand

You would be better to ask only about you don't understand<br>
’もう一度、言って’ is not recommended.<br><br>

##### 3. When the connection is not good

It's better to use ’音声の調子が悪いようです’.<br>
’お電話が遠いようです’ is good also for a specific situation.<br>
’すみません、分かりません’ is not recommended.

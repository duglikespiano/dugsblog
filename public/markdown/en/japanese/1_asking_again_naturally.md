### 1. When you didn't hear someone's talking

**It's better to use ’うん？’.**<br>
’はあ？’ is not recommended.<br><br>

### 2. When there's a expression you don't understand

**You would be better to ask only about you don't understand**<br>
’もう一度、言って’ is not recommended.<br><br>

### 3. When the connection is not good

**It's better to use ’音声の調子が悪いようです’.**<br>
’お電話が遠いようです’ is good also for a specific situation.<br>
’すみません、分かりません’ is not recommended.
